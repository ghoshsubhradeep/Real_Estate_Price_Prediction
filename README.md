# Real_Estate_Price_Prediction

In this data science and machine learning project, I try to predict real estate price of various types.

Here is the folder structure,
- client : This contains ui website code
- server: Python flask server
- model: Contains python notebook for model building

Technologies used in this project,
- Python
- Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter notebook, visual studio code as IDE
- Python flask for http server
- HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

To run and predict on your own,
- Firstly, Store all these folders into a single folder
- Secondly, run server.py to start the Flask Server
- Then from client folder run app.html and provide the required data for predicting price
